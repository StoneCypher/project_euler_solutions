project_euler_solutions
=======================

My solutions to various Project Euler questions.  Various languages.  Spoilers inside.





But that's enabling!
--------------------

Not really.  If someone wants to up their score the wrong way, then let 'em.  Those scores are fairly meaningless.

Besides, there are tons of lists of solutions all over the place in various languages.





So why put them up?
-------------------

To let people compare solutions.  Sometimes you can learn a lot from a tricky way that someone else solved a problem.  It may be that someone can learn from my approach, or at least get a good solid laugh out of it.





Polemic :neckbeard:
